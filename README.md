## Description
An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility  ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

As a marketing agency looking to stay ahead of the market, Horiseon saw a need for a code base that followed accessibility standards and have a final product fully optimized for search engines
